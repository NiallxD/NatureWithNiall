# Test Page

Hi, you've landed on my testing page! I use this page to test new ideas, see how code interacts with the back end plugins, and generally just experiment with the Digital Garden Plugin in a space that doesn't impact my main site.

If you're here by accident, sorry about that! You can get back on track by clicking [here](https://www.niallbell.com). If you were sent here by me, thanks for stopping by! What you see on here should make sense but if not let me know.

## Embed Test

I've included two embeds below to show what it might look like to embed the Terradapt map page into a website. For reference, this website (niallbell.com) uses an 1000 pixel wide content container, the invisible box that all my web content sits within. 

### 100% Width

The embed below is set to load the content in a box which takes up 100% of the width of my content container (1000px). The height is constrained to 600 px. The full screen parameter is enabled which allows users to enlarge the iframe content to the full extent of their screen.

  width="100%" 
  height="600" 
  style="border:none;" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>


### 1500px Width

This embed is set to load the content into a container 1500 pixels wide, which exceeds the max width of my content container, so things might look odd. I wanted to include this to show how the embed might look on a site with a wider content container. The height is set to 600 px and fullscreen mode is enabled.

  width="1500" 
  height="600" 
  style="border:none;" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

### 800px Width

This embed is set to load the content into a container 800 pixels wide, which is a typical width for websites. I wanted to include this to show how the embed might look on a site with a smaller content container. The height is set to 600 px and fullscreen mode is enabled.

  width="800" 
  height="600" 
  style="border:none;" 
  allowfullscreen>

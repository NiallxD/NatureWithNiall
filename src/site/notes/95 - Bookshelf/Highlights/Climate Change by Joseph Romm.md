# Climate Change
## My Summary


## Highlights

“Phytoplankton—photosynthetic microbes that drift in sunlit water—produces a compound called dimethylsulphide (DMS). Some of this enters the atmosphere and reacts to make sulphuric acid, which clumps into aerosols, or microscopic airborne particles. Aerosols seed the formation of clouds, which help cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight.” However, as the ocean acidifies, seawater appears to generate less DMS. — location: [1743]()

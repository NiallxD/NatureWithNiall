When such a promise proves hard to keep in Zeus’s presence, Artemis transforms Kallisto into a bear as punishment for her unchastity. Kallisto’s son, Arkas, later hunts his mother, not recognizing the bear as his own flesh and blood.

In 1902, Roosevelt went on a four-day bear hunting trip to the forests of Mississippi. He soon fell behind his hunting guide, who ran off ahead with his hounds and cornered a small female black bear. The distressed bear attacked one of the dogs, crushing its spine, then went at another. The guide jumped into the fray and cracked the bear on the head with the butt of his rifle. Tying the helpless black bear to a willow tree, he called for the president to come and finish the kill. When poor Teddy finally caught up, he refused to shoot the semiconscious bear as he believed it was lacking in sportsmanship. Instead, the bedraggled Roosevelt instructed his companions to kill the bear with a knife and put the animal out of its misery. This questionable act of compassion soon made its way into the newspapers as a political cartoon labeled “Drawing the Line in Mississippi,” and it featured a small feeble black bear with big round ears. This cartoon would allegedly serve as the inspiration for the first “Teddy” bear. By the end of the decade, nearly a million of the stuffed toys were in production. — location: [377]()

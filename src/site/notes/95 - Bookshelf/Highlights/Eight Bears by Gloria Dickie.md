# Eight Bears
## My Summary

Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I found Eight Bears to be a fascinating, and eye-opening read about the eight extant bear species living on earth. The stories of each bear are explored from a ecological and historical perspective with ample writing addressing the plight of each species.

Overall a very enjoyable read and one which opened my eyes to some elements of the bruin world I never knew existed.

## Highlights

I’d come to Boulder from Canada, a place that the country’s founders had once considered naming Ursalia, meaning “place of bears,” for its abundant bruins. — location: [53]()

When such a promise proves hard to keep in Zeus’s presence, Artemis transforms Kallisto into a bear as punishment for her unchastity. Kallisto’s son, Arkas, later hunts his mother, not recognizing the bear as his own flesh and blood. Zeus intervenes, sending Kallisto and her son to live on among the burning stars as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. — location: [161]()

In 1902, Roosevelt went on a four-day bear hunting trip to the forests of Mississippi. He soon fell behind his hunting guide, who ran off ahead with his hounds and cornered a small female black bear. The distressed bear attacked one of the dogs, crushing its spine, then went at another. The guide jumped into the fray and cracked the bear on the head with the butt of his rifle. Tying the helpless black bear to a willow tree, he called for the president to come and finish the kill. When poor Teddy finally caught up, he refused to shoot the semiconscious bear as he believed it was lacking in sportsmanship. Instead, the bedraggled Roosevelt instructed his companions to kill the bear with a knife and put the animal out of its misery. This questionable act of compassion soon made its way into the newspapers as a political cartoon labeled “Drawing the Line in Mississippi,” and it featured a small feeble black bear with big round ears. This cartoon would allegedly serve as the inspiration for the first “Teddy” bear. By the end of the decade, nearly a million of the stuffed toys were in production. — location: [377]()

For example, after Xi Jinping was photographed looking a little pudgy next to a lean Barack Obama in 2013, Internet memes drew snide comparisons between Xi and Winnie-the-Pooh.

When this strategy failed, they screened panda pornography and administered herbal remedies to bolster the bears’ libido. “We used Chinese Lion Pills and even Viagra,” Zhang explained.

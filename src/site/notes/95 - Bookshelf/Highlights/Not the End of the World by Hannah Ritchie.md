Would it be possible to achieve this by just redistributing the world’s money? No: the global economy would have to be at least five times bigger than it is today. That’s right: to lift everyone out of poverty, with a level of equality like Denmark, the global economy would need to increase five-fold. If everyone in the world lived on $30 per day with zero inequality (so the richest and poorest both get $30), the global economy would need to more than double. — location: [759]()

These substances – the most well known being chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) – were being used in refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, aerosol sprays and industry. By measuring concentrations of chlorine molecules throughout the lower atmosphere, they realised that these gases were not breaking down. Instead, they were rising through into the higher stratosphere.18 There, UV radiation would break the chlorine atoms free, allowing them to react with ozone, and destroying it. — location: [923]()

Forty-three countries signed the Montreal Protocol in 1987, agreeing to phase out ozone-depleting substances from 1989 onwards. The first countries to take action were mostly richer ones that were the main industrial producers – the US, Canada, Japan, most of Europe and New Zealand. Their aim was to halve global production by 1999 before working towards a total phase-out later.22, 23 — location: [939]()

This journey is often called the ‘Environmental Kuznets Curve’:fn4 plot an environmental metric against income and it forms an upside-down ‘U’ (it’s low when we’re poor; it rises to reach its peak at middle incomes; then falls again as we get richer).

Some scientists think this number could be even bigger: some of the most recent and widely cited studies estimate that at least 9 million people die every year from the air they breathe.27, 28 To put these numbers into context, this is similar to the death toll from smoking: around 8 million.29 It’s six or seven times higher than the number of people that die in road accidents: 1.3 million. Hundreds of times more than the number that die from terrorism or war each year. Air pollution is the silent killer that doesn’t get enough headlines. — location: [1015]()

There is no single estimate of how much air pollution costs us in monetary terms; it depends on what ‘price’ we put on poor health and early death. But most studies come up with a similar order of magnitude: trillions of dollars are lost globally every year from ill health, sick days, loss of productivity, crop losses and other ‘hidden’ impacts.36 In a 2022 report by the World Bank, this figure was $8.1 trillion, which was equal to 6% of global GDP.37 — location: [1096]()

As I write, the UK is seeing a surge in popularity for open wood fires and stoves. These seem like an eco-friendly way to heat your home – it’s what we used to do before we started burning fossil fuels – and feel more ‘natural’ and ‘primitive’. But burning wood is what many of the world’s poorest are trying to move away from. It creates large amounts of pollution inside your house, and also contributes to pollution outdoors. It’s much worse than gas or electricity. Burning these solid fuels was once a massive problem that we solved. Let’s resist the temptation to roll back this progress: it might feel like the eco-friendly thing to do, but the data tells us that it’s not. — location: [1212]()

China tops the emissions list. This is not surprising because it’s home to the most people. It emits around 29% of the world’s emissions. The US is in second place at 14%.

We can already see the inequalities. India is responsible for 7% of emissions but is home to 18% of the world population. The US contributes 14% of emissions but is home to just 4% of people.

The picture is also skewed when we look at each country’s historical responsibility. To do this we add up all of a country’s emissions since 1750. The US is way out in front, having contributed 25% of the world’s emissions. The EU comes in second at 17%. China slips down the list to third place, having contributed only half as much as the US.

We’re going to compare electricity sources based on a metric called the ‘levelized costs of energy’ (LCOE).

---
When comparing the land use of energy sources, we need to think about more than just the space used by the plant itself – the area that the coal plant or solar panel physically takes up. We also need to include the land used to mine the materials, extract the fuels, handle the waste at the end. A large assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe estimated the land needed by each source to produce one unit of electricity, when we consider all of these steps of the supply chain.26 — location: [1572]()

Of course, that’s not our only option with solar PV, which we can also put on roofs. Then, the only land use is for mining. In that case, solar PV is almost as good as gas and is much better than coal. — location: [1581]()

In a world with low-carbon electricity, we could reduce this number. If the world moved to 100% nuclear, we’d need just 0.01% of the world’s land. If we used solar panels on roofs, it’d be 0.02% to 0.06%. — location: [1592]()

Things to stress less about The reputation of being a climate data person is hard to shake. Doctors at a party get asked about everyone’s potential life-ending illnesses. I get asked ‘Is this really bad for the environment?’ or ‘What’s worse: this or that?’ These questions often go really deep – right down to the behaviours that emit just grams of CO2. I’m happy to answer them, not least because I’ve geeked out on all the relevant numbers. The book How Bad are Bananas? The Carbon Footprint of Everything by Mike Berners-Lee was the bible I used to carry everywhere with me.51 I was desperate to understand and optimise every tiny detail of my carbon footprint. I wanted to know if I should use the hand dryer or a paper towel. (The answer is paper towel if you’re just using one sheet, but hand dryer if you go for two.) Is it more climate-friendly to read a book or watch TV? (It’s definitely reading a book.) Should I use the dishwasher or the sink? (Unless you use cold water, or hot water very sparingly, the dishwasher wins.) These comparisons are fun and nerdy. But sometimes they can do more harm than good. I can justify spending a lot of time on them because it’s my job. But people shouldn’t be stressed out by every tiny decision they make. It can get overwhelming. Tackling climate change feels like a massive sacrifice that has taken over our lives. That would be okay if all of these actions were really making a difference, but they’re not. It’s misplaced effort and stress, sometimes even at the cost of the few actions that really will matter. There is a concept called ‘moral licensing’: it explains the psychological trick we play on ourselves where we justify one behaviour because we’ve made a sacrifice somewhere else. So, we go for the steak because we’ll recycle the plastic wrapper it comes in. Or, we’ll drive rather than cycle across town because we used the ‘eco-friendly’ setting on the washing machine. When we ask people what they think are the most effective things they can do to reduce their carbon footprint, they often mention the stuff that has the smallest impact.52 Recycling, using more efficient light bulbs, not leaving their television on standby or hanging their washing out to dry. They often miss the big stuff: eating less meat, switching to an electric car, taking one less flight, insulating their home or investing in low-carbon energy.53 That’s why understanding the numbers is important. Not so we can stress about how much CO2 we’re emitting by watching Netflix, but by helping people understand the handful of behaviour changes that really make a difference. So, what should we all stress less about when it comes to climate change? In no particular order, here is a list of common things that people think make a big difference, but usually have a small impact on their carbon footprint. Sure, continue doing them if you want to (I do some), but don’t stress and definitely don’t do them instead of the big things that really do matter. ➤ Recycling your plastic bottles (see Chapter 7) ➤ Replacing old light bulbs with energy-efficient ones ➤ You don’t have to stop watching TV, streaming movies or using the internet ➤ How you read: whether it’s Kindle, paper or audiobook, it doesn’t matter ➤ Washing your dishes in the dishwasher, it doesn’t matter much ➤ Eating local food (see Chapter 5) ➤ Eating organic food (this can be worse for your carbon footprint – see Chapter 5) ➤ Leaving your television or computer on standby, it doesn’t matter much ➤ Leaving your phone charger plugged in, it doesn’t matter much ➤ Plastic or paper bag – your plastic bag actually has a lower carbon footprint, but it doesn’t matter much fn7 — location: [1889]()

Researchers mapped out scenarios of how this would change if everyone in the world adopted different diets. Still, it gives us an interesting look at what our global land use could look like.

What you eat matters much more than where it has come from Transport and packaging emissions are usually a small part of the carbon footprint of our food.

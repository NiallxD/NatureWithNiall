# The Genius of Birds
## My Summary

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I really enjoyed this read. It is incredibly in depth on all things bird brain and some of the stories in there are eye opening. I never really know how impressive racing pigeons were!

INTELLIGENCE IS a slippery concept, even in our own species, tricky to define and tricky to measure. One psychologist describes it as “the capacity to learn or to profit by experience.” And another, as “the capacity to acquire capacity”— — location: [140]()

bald eagles ice fishing in northern Arizona. The birds had discovered a cache of dead fathead minnows frozen under the surface of an ice-covered lake. They were seen chipping holes in the ice, then jumping up and down on the surface, using their body weight to push the minnows up through the holes. — location: [538]()

The signature chickadee-dee-dee flags a stationary predator, a raptor perched in the treetops or an eastern screech owl looming on a limb above. The number of those skipping-stone dees indicates the predator’s size and hence the degree of threat. More dees means a smaller, more dangerous predator. — location: [619]()

In fact, we owe the expression “pecking order” to studies of the social relations among chickens by the Norwegian zoologist Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe, who found that pecking orders are ladderlike, with the top rung conferring great privilege in the form of food and safety, and the bottom rung fraught with vulnerability and risk. — location: [1581]()

Blue jays can select fertile acorns with 88 percent accuracy. They can also count to at least five. And they can neatly mimic the piercing cry of a red-shouldered hawk, kee-ah, kee-ah—which they do often, perhaps to fool other birds into believing there’s a raptor in the vicinity, leaving more nuts for the taking. — location: [1670]()

About 80 percent of bird species live in socially monogamous pairs, that is, they stay with the same partner for a single breeding season or longer. — location: [1874]()

A male budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) shows his commitment to his mate by drumming up a perfect imitation of her “contact” call, the special call she uses to keep in touch with her partner as she flies, feeds, and otherwise goes about her day. — location: [1891]()
{ #ref-9790}


---
After only a few days together, pair-bonded budgerigars can converge on the same contact call, with the male managing a bona fide imitation of the female. Her call becomes his. The female uses the accuracy of his imitation to judge his commitment to courting her and his suitability as a mate. — location: [1893]()
{ #ref-61543}


---
“It could also explain why parrot enthusiasts suggest that the ‘best talkers’ among pet budgerigars are typically males that were obtained when very young and kept in isolation from other budgerigars,” write the scientists. “Budgerigars raised under these conditions probably become imprinted on humans and may begin to court them.” — location: [1898]()

However, it’s not clear whether a male’s song performance actually correlates with his performance on other cognitive tasks. The evidence is mixed. — location: [2643]()

An award for nest-building brilliance should go to the long-tailed tit, a common relative of the chickadee that lives in Europe and Asia. Its nest is a flexible bag composed of small-leaved mosses that form hooks, which are woven together with the silk loops of fluffy spider egg cocoons to create a kind of “Velcro.” — location: [2721]()

All twenty or so species live in the rainforests and woodlands of New Guinea and Australia; seventeen species build bowers. They are the only animals on the planet—except us, perhaps—known to use objects in extravagant displays to lure mates. — location: [2759]()

Missouri biologist discovered a truly novel nesting site when he noticed sparrows carrying food to a working oil pump in McPherson, Kansas. In inspecting the pumps, he found they contained three nests, all with young. Two of the nests were in constant motion with each cycle of the pump, seesawing about two feet up and down every few seconds. — location: [3870]()

According to one account, a sparrow at the Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt, New Zealand, was seen opening a double set of automatic doors leading to the cafeteria. A few minutes later the sparrow activated both sensors to return outside. — location: [3893]()

The great tits of those woods time the laying and hatching of their eggs to coincide with the spring peak of the moth caterpillars they feed to their young. The caterpillars emerge from their pupae with the blossoming of trees in spring, the timing of which is dictated by temperature. As temperatures have risen over the past half century, tree blossoming and the caterpillar boom are occurring earlier than they did when the study began in 1960. If the tits were hardwired to lay their eggs at the same time every year, they would miss the caterpillar boom and their young would starve. But the birds have apparently tracked this shift and are now laying their eggs about two weeks earlier. — location: [4084]()

Many migratory birds also depend on precisely timed stopovers for feeding at critical points along their routes. Take the red knot, a bird of modest brain but prodigious travel. Each spring, it journeys ninety-three hundred miles from Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic. For thousands of years the red knot has relied for sustenance on a precisely timed rendezvous with horseshoe crabs laying their eggs on the beaches of the Delaware Bay. The eggs are so packed with fat that a red knot can double its body weight in just ten days of feasting. Since the 1980s, the red knot population has dropped by 75 percent, largely because of overharvesting of horseshoe crabs. — location: [4097]()

But does this affect the populations of the small birds that cats kill? This may sound a silly question, but it’s not clear that they do, at least in the long term. — location: [872]()

On cats killing birds

because cats catch so many small birds, other predators such as the sparrowhawk lose out. — location: [878]()

So if there were fewer than eight million cats in Britain, there would probably be more than the current 40,000 pairs of sparrowhawks. — location: [880]()

the sparrowhawk’s species name, Nisus, is even more intriguing. Nisus, king of Megara, was turned into a bird of prey after the city was betrayed by his daughter Scylla. What happened to Scylla, you might ask? She was turned into a lark, condemned for ever to fly around in fear of her father. Revenge is a dish best served for eternity. — location: [888]()

Why was there such a fixation with establishing the Little Owl in England? It was probably its association with Athene, at a time when most educated people still felt that the Ancient Greeks represented the pinnacle of civilisation. — location: [912]()

Ring-Necked Parakeet – another species introduced to Britain, this time from Africa and Asia – has shown an astonishing rise, growing by 700 per cent since 1995.

In 1889 a group of well-to-do women gathered in Didsbury, a Manchester suburb, in an effort to stop the use of birds in fashion.

cultures. A European legend mentioned by the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recounts a contest to decide who would hold this title. It was decided that the most fitting way was to pick the bird that could fly the highest. The eagle appeared to be a dead cert, but the tiny wren was hiding in its plumage, and jumped out to fly a little higher and clinch the title just when the eagle had reached its zenith. So the wren won by opposing power with guile. — location: [1990]()

But let’s not forget Patrick Matthew. If you haven’t heard of him, this is because you are merely impressively, rather than impeccably, well read. Matthew was actually the first man to think of the idea of natural selection, expounding the theory in 1831 – the very year that the Beagle set out but before it reached the Galapagos chain. Matthew’s mistake was to publish it in a book with the exceptionally dull name, On Naval Timber and Arboriculture. — location: [2794]()

And what of the finches? It turns out that they’re not finches after all, but tanagers, a large family of birds in the Americas that look a bit like finches, with the same short, rounded wings. But Darwin’s Tanagers does not have the same satisfyingly portentous dum-de dum-de rhythm as Darwin’s Finches, so perhaps for that trivial reason the name has stuck. Even a genius like Darwin made little mistakes – which is quite reassuring for us ordinary people. — location: [2804]()

According to folklore, every time the cuckoo sound was heard, a wife somewhere had just been unfaithful to her husband – hence the word ‘cuckolded’, used for a man whose wife has a tryst with another man. — location: [2824]()

The mother simply lays the eggs, but the father assigns himself, like all fathers who like tinkering with DIY, the task of building a huge mound of leaves and earth, sometimes 5 feet high and more than 10 feet wide, before the laying of the eggs. Occasionally he sticks his neck in it to make sure it’s the right temperature – a heady heat of 33–35°C. But there is a serious purpose behind this outwardly eccentric behaviour: he is building an oven warm enough to incubate the eggs, without the body heat of mum or dad. By the time the newly born bird has hatched, the parents are far away, and they will never knowingly meet their progeny. — location: [2864]()

Aristotle recorded that the European Nightjar – the species found in Britain – made livestock go blind by sucking their milk, which explains the Latin name Caprimulgus given to one branch of the family, meaning ‘goat sucker’. Although the name is an inaccurate slur that should prompt writs from the nightjars’ lawyers, it has stuck – and so has the nightjar’s evil reputation. — location: [2992]()

Banding birds can help scientists figure out how long birds live, how large their populations are, how they behave when defending a territory and raising young, and much more. Banding also has a special role in the management of waterfowl populations, because it helps wildlife authorities set harvesting limits for ducks and geese; there are even special “reward bands” that hunters receive a small cash reward for reporting, to help calculate the chances that someone who shoots a banded bird will report — location: [192]()

Birds aren’t just feathery mammals; their physiology is very different from ours. Like us, birds have lungs that exchange carbon dioxide in the blood for oxygen, but the similarities in how we breathe stop there. Bird lungs don’t expand and contract; instead, air is pumped through them in a single direction by a system of air sacs. This is a much more efficient system than ours, and it helps explain how bar-headed geese can manage sustained flight through the thin air at the roof of the world. — location: [1787]()

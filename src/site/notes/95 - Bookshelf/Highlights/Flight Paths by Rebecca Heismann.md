Banding birds can help scientists figure out how long birds live, how large their populations are, how they behave when defending a territory and raising young, and much more. Banding also has a special role in the management of waterfowl populations, because it helps wildlife authorities set harvesting limits for ducks and geese; there are even special “reward bands” that hunters receive a small cash reward for reporting, to help calculate the chances that someone who shoots a banded bird will report — location: [192]()

Birds aren’t just feathery mammals; their physiology is very different from ours. Like us, birds have lungs that exchange carbon dioxide in the blood for oxygen, but the similarities in how we breathe stop there. Bird lungs don’t expand and contract; instead, air is pumped through them in a single direction by a system of air sacs. This is a much more efficient system than ours, and it helps explain how bar-headed geese can manage sustained flight through the thin air at the roof of the world. — location: [1787]()

However, in recent years many organizations have been moving away from this term due to the political connotations related to the concept of who is and is not a “citizen” of a particular place. I will be using the modern phrase “community science” throughout this chapter.) — location: [2870]()

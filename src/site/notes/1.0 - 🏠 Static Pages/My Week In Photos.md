# My Week In Photos

I spend a great deal of my time out in nature, creating photographs of the goings-on of nature, big and small. And while I do work full time, in my spare time might I add, I do still manage to spend hours in nature each week. This page is updated weekly and is a summary of some of the highlights from the week.

It's important to note that these aren't portfolio images but instead are photos which illustrate my experiences with wildlife and nature. Past weeks can be found at the bottom, I encourage you to have a browse.

> [!tip]+ WC 24th June 2024
> This week has been an exciting one for sure! It started off as standard, and I even managed a half day at Potteric Carr. But Saturday evening turned very special after I decided to 'twitch' a bird that was literally 10 mins from where I live.
> 
> 
> #### Coot Attack
> 
> Coot are spotted pretty much everywhere you find water. They are a fairly dull bird, with a blackish plumage and white bill/forehead. Where the lack in looks, they make up for in attitude. Its common to see coot bee-lining for a nearby intruder in a water skipping fashion. 
>

> 
> 
> #### Common Tern
> 
> Tern may by lumped in with seagulls by those who are uninitiated, but to me there are super special. Not only are they a fishing bird (I like birds that have a taste for fish) but it's an elegant one at that. They fly with a bouncy enthusiasm and are so aerobatic that they wouldn't look out of place in Top Gun.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/5JAjYXi.jpeg)
> 
> 
> #### Lifer! Caspian Tern
> 
> Ok, this is a special one. The photograph is poor even by some of the worst standards, but it was taken at nearly 10:30 pm in the dark! Caspian tern are a widespread and are seen in the UK each summer, but are scarce. I was actually out looking for a rather rare bird to the UK, a black-winged Pratincole. I managed to glimpse of this bird in the grass before getting a great sighting of it in flight. Shortly before leaving, a fellow birder spotted the Caspian tern which just doubled up on the productivity of this local jaunt!

> [!tip]- WC 17th June 2024
> Another busy week, but I did still manage to get out to some local spots to see what was about. This includes checking up on the kingfisher families in Sheffield.
> 
> 
> #### Heron Perched
> 
> It always surprises me when I see a heron perched out of the water. Their long spindly legs clasping onto the branches. I think this heron is a juvenile bird as it's still not get full heron colouration. 
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/BO8XYpP.jpeg)
> 
> 
> #### Adult Kingfisher
> 
> After what will have been weeks of heavy fishing, this adult male appears to be taking a break and catching some fish for himself. A juvenile was spotted nearby but was not getting given fish which makes me think this adult will have been feeding several hungry bills for a week. It much be hard work!
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/766GdFw.jpeg)
> 
> 
> #### Juvenile Kingfisher
> 
> Juvenile Kingfishers are identified by their shorter bill, grey feet and dust looking plumage. This adorable little bird was sat begging for fish from a nearby adult. Eventually this bird did dive into the water but didn't manage to catch a fish. These few days after the parents stop feeding are crucial for a young kingfisher. If they don't get the hang of fishing, they may well die.

> [!tip]- WC 10th June 2024
> Unfortunately this week is not a 'my week in photos' because unusually I didn't take any! Actually, that's a lie, I took some of my cat looking cute and I did photograph a cuckoo but didn't end up processing the images.
> 
> The first week back from travels is tough! I had lots of work to catch up on and had uni work looming. So, this week I'll be sharing some more photos from my trip to the Isle of Skye!
> 
> #### Common Seal
> 
> I've photographed grey seals extensively over the years but never have I been able to do the common seal justice. During our ride out to Loch Coruisk, we happened upon a colony of common seal. The vantage point from the boat combined with the still water made for some stunning photos!
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/COZKurb.jpeg)
> 
> #### Loch Coruisk
> 
> This is a freshwater loch contained within the centre of the Black Cuillins, a mountain range in the southern parts of the Isle of Skye. The loch is fed by streams from the mountains and flows out into the sea, as seen in the bottom left. This was a unreal experience.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/t3pESMu.jpeg)
> 
> #### Lealt Falls
> 
> This photograph is of the lower falls, which when combined with the upper falls, covers a drop of 90 metres. We hiked down the cliffside to get to the bottom falls which was totally worth it. The viewing platform of the upper falls was just as epic but not conducive to photographs.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/moNZkz6.jpeg)
> 
> #### Toby
> 
> In order to ensure I am meeting the purpose of this blog, here is a photo I took this week. This is the cat of my life, Toby, enjoying the sunshine.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/YCd9cV4.jpeg)

> [!tip]- WC 3rd June 2024
> Damn, I'm a day late on this one! In my defence I was travelling a lot on Sunday so I didn't really get chance to draft up this week. So here it is, on a Monday!
> 
> I spent the week exploring the Isle of Skye with Claudia so I've got plenty to share. I'll go with 5 photos this week as there was so much to see and share! I will be drafting up a blog post with more photos from this trip so check it out here! <- I've not published it yet!
> 
> #### Lifer! Manx Shearwater
> 
> This is one of those birds that I just never knew existed until recent years. When I was on Mull last year, I really hoped to see one, however I was unsuccessful. Manx Shearwater are rarely seen from land so you need to jump on a boat to get close to them. I was lucky here, one our return leg from Loch Coruisk, Claudia spotted a bird and snapped some shots. I later identified it as a Manx shearwater!
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/vidEVH9.jpeg)
> 
> #### Neist Point
> 
> Neist Point is familiar to most people when they see it. Of course it is it...it's iconic! Neist Point is the most westerly point one can drive in the UK without getting a boat. It is actually more west than Dublin and Belfast! Westerly facts aside, this spot is stunning. The cliffs are alive with seabirds and the grasses teeming with Wheatear and a special little bird, the Twite! I've shared a 360 Panorama of this location which you can view [[3.0 - 📷 Photography/3.1 - 🏞️ Galleries/3.1.5 - 🌍 360 Panorama/3.1.5.1 - 360 Panorama\|here]].
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/b82Oi9c.jpeg)
>
> #### Lifer! Twite
> 
> Perhaps about as unassuming as one can get when it comes to birds. The Twite is a small finch closely related to the Linnet. The bird is brown with a streaky pattern. The only way I knew for sure this was a Twite and not a Linnet was because of the pink rump I spotted as it flew off. Twite are becoming more and more rare in England so it's really important we manage habitats to best ensure they can survive. If not it will join the long list of extinct species hardly anyone knew about.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/5PHTchB.jpeg)
>
> #### The Old Man of Storr
> 
> Skye's most popular attraction. The Old Man of Storr is a pinnacle that sits below the highest peak of the Trotternish Ridge called The Storr. In front of the old man there is another pinnacle called The Cathedral, named such because of the holes in the rock which look like windows of a ruined cathedral. We hiked up to the Photographers Knoll, a viewpoint, to take in the sights and snap some photos. Thankfully we got up there before the crowds as this spot started getting busy as we made our way down. Superb, if not very bleak and desolate, views across the Trotternish Ridge which runs the full length of the northern most peninsula.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/itcbAD7.jpeg)
>
> #### Otter!
> 
> It wouldn't be a true trip to Scotland without sighting an otter and Claudia came through with this one again! She spotted the otter on Mull last year and did the same again here. We were walking to a coffee trailer when she called out that something was in the water, I put my bins on it and knew instantly it was an otter! We made a beeline for the van to get our cameras and was able to fire off some shots as it moved across the bank of Loch Slapin.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/Z0b7Zhc.jpeg)

> [!tip]- WC 27th May 2024
> I’m writing this weeks’ update from a very wet campsite on the north-eastern edge of the Isle of Skye. Here’s to hoping it brightens up for the rest of the trip! Despite the poor weather, we have had some nice opportunities to photograph the Scottish landscape. 
> 
> #### Ben Nevis Range
> 
> The drive from Doncaster to Skye is about 9 hours so we decided to stop off for the night at Fort William. I’ve driven through many times, but never have I been able to enjoy the scenery. Thankfully, the weather was amazing and from our campsite I was able to create this amazing panorama of the Nevis Mountain Range.
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/zJx7DAw.jpeg)
> 
> #### Red-legged Partridge
> 
> Earlier in the week, on my morning bike ride, I spotted a brightly coloured bird sitting on a rock beside the path. I quickly pulled my camera from my bag and snapped a few pics. I’ve never got this close to a red-legged partridge so the encounter was welcomed!
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/2RMkhX0.jpeg)
>
> #### Lifer! Common Crossbill
> 
> The common crossbill is a bird I've sought for a while, albeit with low effort. I remember at least a few occasions looking for this bird but have not been successful until a chance encounter today when exploring the pine forests on Skye. Once you see them they become very distinguishable with their orange plumage and chunky head!
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/LVrmxLh.jpeg)
>

> [!tip]- WC 20th May 2024
> This week was one of those busy weeks again where I didn't get much change to get out before/after work. We also had some wet weather which is rarely conducive to excellent nature experiences! That said, I still managed to pull off some rather special photographs!
> 
> #### Hungry Stoat
> 
> Nature is cruel, we usually learn this from a young age but you're still never prepared. As I walked down a path with Claudia, she spotted something running towards us (I was distracted by a reed warbler!). We soon realised what it was and I managed to fire off a few shots. Stoat are well known for taking down prey larger than themselves, and this coot chick was no match to the fatal accuracy of a stoat bite.
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/CGrs48d.jpeg)
> 
> #### Meadow Pipit
> 
> A bird which has somehow escaped my observation. I have seen a few before, there were loads on Mull, but I've not added any to a list or photographed them. That technically makes this a lifer. I have in the past probably confused these with skylarks as they possess a similar aesthetic, although on reflection they are unique when you train your eye.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/0UIS7oL.jpeg)
>
> #### Common Cuckoo
> 
> I've been trying to photograph the common cuckoo for far too long. Admittedly, I've probably not put in enough effort in the past, however this year I was determined to do so. As I plan to travel to Canada early next year, I'm on a mission to photograph species that I won't see there. So the Common Cuckoo was on the list. After a dreadful storm, the skies cleared and I decided to give a local spot where I'd heard a cuckoo calling recently. To my amazement, upon turning a corner, there was a cuckoo, perched on a tree...It's moments like this which make all the effort worth it.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/rsqraJi.jpeg)
>*I should note that I had cloned out an annoying twig in this photo.*

> [!tip]- WC 13th May 2024
> I didn't manage to get out too much this week due to cracking on with my Uni work and some other commitments, but I did still manage to get 2.5 lifers before Sunday! I'm going to break convention and share four images this week, because I can't not share them!
> 
> #### Great White Egret
> 
> While not technically the first great white egret I've seen, it was the first I've seen in England. I saw one in Florida in 2016 and while that was my first sighting, it wasn't the best. On 17th, I woke up at 5:30am to ride to a local nature reserve. In the distance I saw what I thought was a swan. On closer inspection I noticed it was standing too tall, this was when I realised it was a great white egret!
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/aTpv0iI.jpeg)
> 
> #### Grasshopper Warbler
> 
> This one is a lifer for me. I've heard of grasshopper warblers, but I didn't know what they looked or sounded like. I should have known what they looked like...most warblers look identical! On the same morning as the egret, I heard a bird song like nothing else...I had to use Merlin Sound ID to finally figure out what it was, even if in hind-sight it was obvious!
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/u2QqCZH.jpeg)
> 
> #### Common Greenshank
> 
> The greenshank is one of those birds I ought to have seen before, but haven't. I'm only 35% birder (65% photographer) so there are plenty of birds like this which have escaped my gaze. Regardless, this was a great sighting at Potteric Carr. The heat haze was really bad so the photographs were no good, but I still thought it was worth sharing!
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/Zs3jiCx.jpeg)
>
> #### Osprey Returns
> 
> Here is the bonus image! This time of year, the UK is marked by a whole range of bird migration. One of which is the osprey returning from the south, Africa. I heard reports from the fantastic, and dedicated, birders of Doncaster that an osprey had been spotted at a local spot, I had to go and see it! I hope to get back and see this bird a few more times, but if the chance doesn't arise, I'm still happy with these shots.
>

> [!tip]- WC 6th May 2024
> This week started off pretty normal but turned quite extraordinary at the weekend!
> 
> There is some really special images here this week so I hope you enjoy!
> 
> #### Dipper Chicks!
> 
> I've been following a family of dippers for about 5 weeks now, and on Friday I headed over to see how they were doing. Much to my amazement I was able to photograph one of the dipper chicks perched at the entrance to the nest hole! How amazing to be able to see this!
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/28al9Ob.jpeg)
> 
> #### Hungry Garden Warbler
> 
> If you have ever tried to spot one of the many warblers that grace our bushes, reeds and tree this time of year, you'll know how difficult they can be to photograph. I was walking home one evening when I heard the delightful song of a garden warbler. I was then lucky enough to photograph it with a small red damselfly in its bill. This was also a lifer for me ([check out my photographic life list here](https://niallbell.com/photographic-life-list/).
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/06HrpqL.jpeg)
>
> #### Aurora Borealise
> 
>I wasn't alone with this one. Thousands of people across the UK were able to witness the incredible Northern Lights in the early hours of Saturday morning. It was an incredible show and I'm so glad that so many people were able to observe such an incredible natural phenomenon. Check out my blog posts for more photos - [[2.0 - 📝 Blog Posts/2.2 - 🌱 Nature/Aurora Borealis in Doncaster\|Aurora Borealis in Doncaster]].

> [!tip]- WC 29th April 2024
> Ok, so two weeks ago, my local zoo effectively banned me from visiting by revoking my annual pass membership and offering me a partial refund; I'm yet to get the refund. Anyway, this has meant that I've been exploring other local spots more, it's been a pleasure for sure! This week has been predominantly Potteric Carr, which is less than a mile from my house.
> 
> Although the dippers don't feature in this weeks feed, I have been photographing them and they are busier than ever feeding their chicks! You can now hear the chicks calling for feed when an adult pops into the nest hole. I love it!
> 
> #### The Confusingly-named Wagtail
> 
> Grey wagtails are a fairly common sight in healthy stream/brook ecosystems in the UK. These little birds, with their grey head and back, and bright yellow chest are always active, flitting about catching flies. I personally would have called this one the Yellow Wagtail...but who am I to judge!
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/fSn8nC0.jpeg)
> 
> #### Aerial Acrobats
> 
> For at least 3 years I've been trying my hardest to take a nice, pleasing photograph of a barn swallow. They are so iconic, being the harbingers of spring, yet until this week, I've never managed to do them justice. This is one of about 2,000 images I took to try and get a nice sharp shot against a nice background. Aren't they gorgeous‽
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/eZs8GEI.jpeg)
>
> #### Marsh Harrier Food Pass
> 
>This is a first for me! For the first time ever last week, I saw two marsh harriers together. Today (the 5th) I saw two passing food to one another! Actually, it gets even better...I saw three march harriers at the same time. Two adults and one juvenile. I saw the juvenile erupt from the reeds infront of the hide in what could have been it's maiden flight! The juv landed on a raised bank and the adults brought food to it; An incredible sight for sure.
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/QFD8aMO.jpeg)

> [!tip]- WC 22nd April 2024
> This week was spent obsessively checking in on my local kingfishers, photographing the dipper family I've been following and checking out some local nature reserves. It'll not come as a surprise that this week is then a collection of Kingfisher, Dipper and something super cool from my local nature reserve. 
> 
> #### Busy Parents
> 
> The dipper family I've been following at Porter Brook in Sheffield are still hard at work feeding their chicks. They have been doing so for nearly two weeks now and yet their activity is unrelenting. It's no easy task for these remarkable little birds.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/jUkGrIh.jpeg)
> 
> #### Shift Change
> 
> At this time of year, [[3.0 - 📷 Photography/3.1 - 🏞️ Galleries/3.1.1 - 🦅 Birds/3.1.1.2 - Kingfisher\|Kingfishers]] are busy incubating the eggs of their first brood. Every few hours they swap over to allow the other bird to eat. They will do this for a few weeks till the eggs hatch, then it will be full steam ahead feeding all the hungry bills
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/HVaIIhU.jpeg)
>
> #### Eurasian Spoonbill
> 
>Mid week I popped into my local nature reserve to see what was about. This time last year we saw a pair of black-winged stilts start nesting so it's always worth a try. I was amazed to see a spoonbill in full breeding plumage sifting the silt for food. I last photographed a spoonbill in July 2016 so this was a very welcome sight!
>
>
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/VXMwO0i.jpeg)

> [!tip]- WC 15th April 2024
> A quieter week indeed but nonetheless excellent. We’re at that point in spring when many of the birds are sitting on eggs so activity levels tend to drop. This week is a dipper bonanza!
> 
> #### Dipper Trio
> 
> The dippers I’ve been following are now hard at working feeding their chicks. Both adult birds are in and out of the nest frequently as they bring back food for the hungry bills within. During a well deserved break, a third dipper came onto the scene much to the pairs dislike. One bird chased the intruder off.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/5PWLvhV.jpeg)
> 
> #### Perched on a Rock
> 
> Dipper are super unique in the UK, they are our only aquatic song bird. Dippers belong to a group of birds called passerines, which we colloquially refer to as song birds. Although, unlike all other song birds, they don't eat seeds (you wont find one in your garden!). They forage underwater for small bugs and shrimps (shrimps is bugs).
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/XCkLmll.jpeg)
> 
> #### Hungry Bills
> 
> Both adult dippers have been coming out of the nest chamber and returning with bills full of invertebrates such as dragonfly larvae. This leads me to believe they are bring food back to hungry bills. I must have watched them return to the nest 15 times today over a few hours. Busy indeed!
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/c08JRco.jpeg)

> [!tip]- WC 8th April 2024
> This week was excellent! I booked Friday off work and headed to RSPB St Aidans before popping over to my local spot for kingfisher and dipper. Both locations were very successful!
> 
> #### Three Great Bittern
> 
> I've only been lucky enough to see a great bittern twice before, once at YWT Potteric Carr and once at NWT Attenborough. Never did I think I would see THREE flying together!
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/KrMWHkt.jpeg)
> 
> #### Black Necked Grebe
> 
> RSPB St Aidans is home to 30% of the UK breeding population of BNGs. The UK only sees around 50 pairs stay to breed so to have such a high density at one site is remarkable. On Friday I counted 13 individuals, all but one were in pairs.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/lodrPh0.jpeg)
> 
> #### Hard Working Dipper
> 
> The dipper is the UK's only aquatic passerine bird which forages for its food in fast flowing streams. Dippers can "fly" underwater which allows them to catch their prey which are usually invertebrates such as caddisfly and insect larvae.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/5s3I1UL.jpeg)

> [!tip]- WC 1st April 2024
> Another busy week of photography as is becoming a habit lately. My main trip out this week was to Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust's Attenborough Nature Reserve. The place was teeming with Great Crested Grebes and chiffchaffs. I also had a great encounter with a Cetti's warbler!
> 
> #### Fishing In The Rain
> 
> I spent a good half an hour photographing several Great Crested Grebes from a small jetty on the main lake. It started raining which made for some interesting shots. This grebe popped up with a huge catch!
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/btTePAp.jpeg)
> 
> #### Spring Has Arrived!
> 
> Incredibly, until this week, I'd never managed to make a clear photograph of a chiffchaff that wasn't a tiny bird sat at the top of a tree. This stunning bird perched at eye level and begun singing away. I managed to fire off several shots before it moved on swiftly.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/nxwcJkU.jpeg)
> 
> #### Heron Ballet
> 
> Have you ever seen a heron do a pirouette? Neither have I, but this male looked to be in this photograph. The heron is quite happy fishing near to people. I decided to use my 50 mm lens to take some wider shots of the heron to showcase how close to the houses this magnificent bird was going about it's day. 
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/BQVY2XN.jpeg)
> 

> [!tip]- WC 25th March 2024
> This week was a kingfisher bonanza with lots of activity at my local spot. The birds are currently readying themselves for their first brood. Over the next few days the female will start laying her eggs which both birds will take turns to incubate. It's all kingies this week!
> 
> #### Sharing A Meal
> 
> I sat and watched this pair of birds almost all day. The male was keeping his mate fed by bringing her fish ever half hour or so. She was assessing his ability to bring in a stead supply of fish; a test for when the pair have up to seven hungry bills to feed!
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/aKJOmoG.jpeg)
> 
> #### Brood One Begins
> 
> After becoming suitable impressed by the constant supply of sticklebacks, the female allowed the male to mate with her, sharing genetic material with a 'cloacal kiss'. Yes, thats the correct term for mating across almost all birds.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/wZaBQkd.jpeg)
> 
> #### The Life Of A King
> 
> Kingfishers have to eat fairly regularly to keep themselves fit and healthy (and alive). Here the male bird photographed above carries a fish from the water to his nearby 'bashing perch' where he will bash the fish to kill it. On occasion the fish doesn't die before being swallowed whole resulting in the bird squirming a bit as it's meal wiggles around.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/jaEuce4.jpeg)
> 

> [!tip]- WC 18th March 2024
> A less busy week from a photography perspective as I battle through university assignments. I did manage to get out to a local spot to see if the short eared owls are still out, which they are.
> 
> #### The Lark Ascending
> 
> One of my all time favourite pieces of music. The Lark Ascending, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams, captures the flight and song of the skylark perfectly. The skylark is an unassuming and small bird but its song is far from it. Once you hear a skylark sing, you never forget it.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/4GCYBi6.jpeg)
> 
> #### Building Energy For Migration
> 
> The short eared owl has resident and migratory populations in the UK. This year has seen vast numbers of them come to our shores in search of their favourite meal, voles. Vole numbers are sensitive to a range of environmental factors and if they has a slow down in reproduction, the owls are forced to look elsewhere. A particularly cold winter in Scandinavia could be the reason for the high number.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/z0zTBs8.jpeg)
> 
> #### Busy Building
> 
>It's that time of year when birds of all shapes and sizes begin building their nests ahead of breeding season. Here the adorable little wren collects an old withered leaf to line it's nest. 
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/POuAXem.jpeg)

> [!tip]- WC 11th March 2024
> **Backdated Post**
>This week was a week of birds! At the time I was spending a lot of time in Sheffield photographing the kingfishers there. Along the way I usually pick up a range of photos including photos of species most don't bother to photograph.
> 
> #### Skylark
> 
> I remember heading to the local spot where I find short-eared owls. Up on the hill there are many skylarks building nests in the long grass. I was able to capture this beautiful photograph of a skylark perched on a grassy tuft.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/cwr932Z.jpeg)
> 
> #### Battle of the Coots
> 
> Like most bird species, coots can get very aggressive around mating season. Here I think several birds are either fighting for a mate, or disputing over territory. Either way, it's great to see them battle it out on the water!
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/7RynhxB.jpeg)
> 
> #### Kingfisher Pair
> 
>It's great watching kingfishers as they pair up for the season. The male will bring fish to the female to demonstrate his ability to their chicks when they hatch. This is a relentless time for the males as they are essentially feeding two adult birds at the same time but is good prep for when the chicks come along.

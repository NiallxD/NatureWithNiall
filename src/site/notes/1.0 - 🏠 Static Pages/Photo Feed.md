## Weekly Feed

This is my weekly roundup of what I've been photographing through the week. It's important to note that these aren't portfolio images but instead are photos which illustrate my experiences with wildlife and nature. Past weeks can be found at the bottom.

> [!tip]+ WC 29th April 2024
> Ok, so two weeks ago, my local zoo effectively banned me from visiting by revoking my annual pass membership and offering me a partial refund; I'm yet to get the refund. Anyway, this has meant that I've been exploring other local spots more, it's been a pleasure for sure! This week has been predominantly Potteric Carr, which is less than a mile from my house.
> 
> Although the dippers don't feature in this weeks feed, I have been photographing them and they are busier than ever feeding their chicks! You can now hear the chicks calling for feed when an adult pops into the nest hole. I love it!
> 
> #### The Confusingly-named Wagtail
> 
> Grey wagtails are a fairly common sight in healthy stream/brook ecosystems in the UK. These little birds, with their grey head and back, and bright yellow chest are always active, flitting about catching flies. I personally would have called this one the Yellow Wagtail...but who am I to judge!
>

> 
> #### Aerial Acrobats
> 
> For at least 3 years I've been trying my hardest to take a nice, pleasing photograph of a barn swallow. They are so iconic, being the harbingers of spring, yet until this week, I've never managed to do them justice. This is one of about 2,000 images I took to try and get a nice sharp shot against a nice background. Aren't they gorgeous‽

>
> #### Marsh Harrier Food Pass
> 
>This is a first for me! For the first time ever last week, I saw two marsh harriers together. Today (the 5th) I saw two passing food to one another! Actually, it gets even better...I saw three march harriers at the same time. Two adults and one juvenile. I saw the juvenile erupt from the reeds infront of the hide in what could have been it's maiden flight! The juv landed on a raised bank and the adults brought food to it; An incredible sight for sure.

> [!tip]- WC 22nd April 2024
> This week was spent obsessively checking in on my local kingfishers, photographing the dipper family I've been following and checking out some local nature reserves. It'll not come as a surprise that this week is then a collection of Kingfisher, Dipper and something super cool from my local nature reserve. 
> 
> #### Busy Parents
> 
> The dipper family I've been following at Porter Brook in Sheffield are still hard at work feeding their chicks. They have been doing so for nearly two weeks now and yet their activity is unrelenting. It's no easy task for these remarkable little birds.
>

> 
> #### Shift Change
> 
> At this time of year, [[3.0 - 📷 Photography/3.1 - 🏞️ Galleries/3.1.1 - 🦅 Birds/3.1.1.2 - Kingfisher\|Kingfishers]] are busy incubating the eggs of their first brood. Every few hours they swap over to allow the other bird to eat. They will do this for a few weeks till the eggs hatch, then it will be full steam ahead feeding all the hungry bills
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/HVaIIhU.jpeg)
>
> #### Eurasian Spoonbill
> 
>Mid week I popped into my local nature reserve to see what was about. This time last year we saw a pair of black-winged stilts start nesting so it's always worth a try. I was amazed to see a spoonbill in full breeding plumage sifting the silt for food. I last photographed a spoonbill in July 2016 so this was a very welcome sight!

> [!tip]- WC 15th April 2024
> A quieter week indeed but nonetheless excellent. We’re at that point in spring when many of the birds are sitting on eggs so activity levels tend to drop. This week is a dipper bonanza!
> 
> #### Dipper Trio
> 
> The dippers I’ve been following are now hard at working feeding their chicks. Both adult birds are in and out of the nest frequently as they bring back food for the hungry bills within. During a well deserved break, a third dipper came onto the scene much to the pairs dislike. One bird chased the intruder off.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/5PWLvhV.jpeg)
> 
> #### Perched on a Rock
> 
> Dipper are super unique in the UK, they are our only aquatic song bird. Dippers belong to a group of birds called passerines, which we colloquially refer to as song birds. Although, unlike all other song birds, they don't eat seeds (you wont find one in your garden!). They forage underwater for small bugs and shrimps (shrimps is bugs).
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/XCkLmll.jpeg)
> 
> #### Hungry Bills
> 
> Both adult dippers have been coming out of the nest chamber and returning with bills full of invertebrates such as dragonfly larvae. This leads me to believe they are bring food back to hungry bills. I must have watched them return to the nest 15 times today over a few hours. Busy indeed!
>

> [!tip]- WC 8th April 2024
> This week was excellent! I booked Friday off work and headed to RSPB St Aidans before popping over to my local spot for kingfisher and dipper. Both locations were very successful!
> 
> #### Three Great Bittern
> 
> I've only been lucky enough to see a great bittern twice before, once at YWT Potteric Carr and once at NWT Attenborough. Never did I think I would see THREE flying together!
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/KrMWHkt.jpeg)
> 
> #### Black Necked Grebe
> 
> RSPB St Aidans is home to 30% of the UK breeding population of BNGs. The UK only sees around 50 pairs stay to breed so to have such a high density at one site is remarkable. On Friday I counted 13 individuals, all but one were in pairs.
> 
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/lodrPh0.jpeg)
> 
> #### Hard Working Dipper
> 
> The dipper is the UK's only aquatic passerine bird which forages for its food in fast flowing streams. Dippers can "fly" underwater which allows them to catch their prey which are usually invertebrates such as caddisfly and insect larvae.

> [!tip]- WC 1st April 2024
> Another busy week of photography as is becoming a habit lately. My main trip out this week was to Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust's Attenborough Nature Reserve. The place was teeming with Great Crested Grebes and chiffchaffs. I also had a great encounter with a Cetti's warbler!
> 
> #### Fishing In The Rain
> 
> I spent a good half an hour photographing several Great Crested Grebes from a small jetty on the main lake. It started raining which made for some interesting shots. This grebe popped up with a huge catch!
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/btTePAp.jpeg)
> 
> #### Spring Has Arrived!
> 
> Incredibly, until this week, I'd never managed to make a clear photograph of a chiffchaff that wasn't a tiny bird sat at the top of a tree. This stunning bird perched at eye level and begun singing away. I managed to fire off several shots before it moved on swiftly.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/nxwcJkU.jpeg)
> 
> #### Heron Ballet
> 
> Have you ever seen a heron do a pirouette? Neither have I, but this male looked to be in this photograph. The heron is quite happy fishing near to people. I decided to use my 50 mm lens to take some wider shots of the heron to showcase how close to the houses this magnificent bird was going about it's day. 
>

> 

> [!tip]- WC 25th March 2024
> This week was a kingfisher bonanza with lots of activity at my local spot. The birds are currently readying themselves for their first brood. Over the next few days the female will start laying her eggs which both birds will take turns to incubate. It's all kingies this week!
> 
> #### Sharing A Meal
> 
> I sat and watched this pair of birds almost all day. The male was keeping his mate fed by bringing her fish ever half hour or so. She was assessing his ability to bring in a stead supply of fish; a test for when the pair have up to seven hungry bills to feed!
>
>![](https://i.imgur.com/aKJOmoG.jpeg)
> 
> #### Brood One Begins
> 
> After becoming suitable impressed by the constant supply of sticklebacks, the female allowed the male to mate with her, sharing genetic material with a 'cloacal kiss'. Yes, thats the correct term for mating across almost all birds.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/wZaBQkd.jpeg)
> 
> #### The Life Of A King
> 
> Kingfishers have to eat fairly regularly to keep themselves fit and healthy (and alive). Here the male bird photographed above carries a fish from the water to his nearby 'bashing perch' where he will bash the fish to kill it. On occasion the fish doesn't die before being swallowed whole resulting in the bird squirming a bit as it's meal wiggles around.

> [!tip]- WC 18th March 2024
> A less busy week from a photography perspective as I battle through university assignments. I did manage to get out to a local spot to see if the short eared owls are still out, which they are.
> 
> #### The Lark Ascending
> 
> One of my all time favourite pieces of music. The Lark Ascending, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams, captures the flight and song of the skylark perfectly. The skylark is an unassuming and small bird but its song is far from it. Once you hear a skylark sing, you never forget it.
> 
>![](https://i.imgur.com/4GCYBi6.jpeg)
> 
> #### Building Energy For Migration
> 
> The short eared owl has resident and migratory populations in the UK. This year has seen vast numbers of them come to our shores in search of their favourite meal, voles. Vole numbers are sensitive to a range of environmental factors and if they has a slow down in reproduction, the owls are forced to look elsewhere. A particularly cold winter in Scandinavia could be the reason for the high number.
>

> 
> #### Busy Building
> 
>It's that time of year when birds of all shapes and sizes begin building their nests ahead of breeding season. Here the adorable little wren collects an old withered leaf to line it's nest.

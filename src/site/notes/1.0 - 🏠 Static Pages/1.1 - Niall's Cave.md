# Niall's Cave 🦇

Step into my cave where I chronicle the echoes of my curiosity and scribble down the musings that would make the mushrooms mirth. This is a personal anthology of the amusing and the incredible.

Beware, if you're scared of spiders and bats you may wish to [[1.0 - 🏠 Static Pages/Don't be scared of spiders and bats\|turn around]].

> *"How could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?"* - *Plato (The Allegory of The Cave)*

# Niall's Cave 🦇

> *"How could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?"* - *Plato (The Allegory of The Cave)*

Step into my cave where I chronicle the echoes of my curiosity and scribble down the musings that would make the mushrooms mirth. This is a personal anthology of the amusing and the incredible. Thats all a bit silly really, but then again, so am I!

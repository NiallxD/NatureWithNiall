# Photo Feed

Most of the time I'm out taking photographs of anything nature and wildlife. Below is my photo feed, which is a collection of images that I've taken each week.

> This week was excellent! I booked Friday off work and headed to RSPB St Aidans before popping over to my local spot for kingfisher and dipper. Both locations were very successful!

> #### Three Great Bittern
> 
> I've only been lucky enough to see a great bittern twice before, once at YWT Potteric Carr and once at NWT Attenborough. Never did I think I would see THREE flying together!

> #### Black Necked Grebe
> 
> RSPB St Aidans is home to 30% of the UK breeding population of BNGs. The UK only sees around 50 pairs stay to breed so to have such a high density at one site is remarkable. On Friday I counted 13 individuals, all but on were in pairs.

> #### Hard Working Dipper
> 
> The dipper is the UK's only aquatic passerine bird which forages for its food in fast flowing streams. Dippers can "fly" underwater which allows them to catch their prey which are usually invertebrates such as caddisfly and insect larvae.

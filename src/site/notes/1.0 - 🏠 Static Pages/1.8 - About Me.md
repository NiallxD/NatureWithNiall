# About Me

It's customary to share a little bit about yourself when you have a portfolio online. I'll keep it short and sweet. 

> I'm a passionate environmentalist and lover of all things wildlife and nature. In my spare time I work in sustainable development but most of the time I'm out photographing all that nature has to offer. I believe that by sharing the joys of nature through photography, we can slowly inspire new people to care a little bit more about the world we call home; and if we fail in our mission to protect nature, we will have immortalised the organisms that perished at the hands of humans to allow future generations to hold us accountable.

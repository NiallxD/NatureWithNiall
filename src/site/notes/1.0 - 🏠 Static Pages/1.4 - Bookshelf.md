While I don't read as much as I would like, and I blame it on the fact that I'm studying a Master's Degree in my spare time, I do still manage to get through a fair few books. Below is a selection of my favourites; think of it as my recommended reads.
| Cover                                                                                                                                              | Title                                                      | Author                 | Read                  | GoodReads                                                                                                                    |

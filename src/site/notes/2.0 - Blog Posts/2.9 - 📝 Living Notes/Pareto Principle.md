#80/20
# Pareto Principle
<p id="reading-time" style="font-style: italic;">⏱️ Approx Reading Time:  <span id="inserted-text"></span> mins</p>
This principle/rule states that you can roughly 80% of the consequences come from 20% of the causes.

Examples: 

1. In 1900, 80% of the land in the Kingdom of Italy was owned by 20% of the population.
2. 80% of companies profits come from 20% of their product line.
3. Fixing the top 20% of the most reported bugs will eliminate 80% of the crashes/issues.
4. 80% of your knowledge is used 20% of the time.
5. 80% of a cities traffic occurs on 20% of it's roads.

I've left this note as one to develop as there might be other interesting cases which I'd like to reflect on.

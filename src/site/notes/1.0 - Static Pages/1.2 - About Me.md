# About Me

I felt it was only right to share a little about who I am. I'm a passionate environmentalist who has great interest in a wide range of topics. This website is a collection of ramblings adapted from my [photography blog](https://niallbell.com/blog/) on my main website, [niallbell.com](https://niallbell.com/)

If you wish to get in touch about anything on this website, please send me an email at niall@niallbell.com.

# Bookshelf

I was never into reading when I was younger, and throughout my twenties I spent that much time studying that I really couldn't face reading _even more_ words on a page. Since finishing my masters degree I've been able to put more time towards reading, and I love it!

Here are the books I've read and recommend. Some books don't make it into my bookshelf if I don't feel they are recommendable. You can view my highlights by clicking the 📝 link below each book.

## 2024 Reading Challenge Progress

I'm unlikely to meet this challenge because of the time I had to put aside to my masters degree, but we can still try!

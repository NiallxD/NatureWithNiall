This is a gallery of photos from UK zoos. But first...

My journey at The Zoo started in 2015 when I bought my first camera. I photographed The Zoo's recently born tiger cubs which lit the spark on my journey to becoming a nature and wildlife photographer. Over the years I became more aware of the issues facing our planets wildlife. The Zoo was a place to see these endangered animals, learn about them, and to share their stories. Better yet, my hard-earned money was going to supporting those animals and to educating those less aware of the plight of the worlds biodiversity. Unfortunately, after nine years of being so, the story ends. The Zoo isn't the place it was when I first went back in 2015. 

My experience at The Zoo has helped shape who I am today; a passionate environmentalist who isn't afraid to speak out against those who make silly decisions. One of the most powerful tools we have as citizens of the world is our voice. We can speak out and challenge the people, companies and governments that coexist with us. When companies set out on a mission, they invest heavily into it. Some hold onto this sentiment and use to guide their growth in a moral and positive way. Others do not.

I support zoos, and I have spent hours of my time arguing with a prominent figure in the UK zoo world. Ironically they argued that zoos should be closed down, while managing two large UK zoos. I criticised their public addresses and argued against their opinions; 

> "Zoos do have a place! A place to showcase, educate, and raise funds for in-situ conservation! Attenborough said it himself, 'people wont protect what they can't see!'. I am a living example of what zoos can do." - me

They disagreed;

>"Zoos do not work! They do not invest sufficiently in in-situ conservation! They do not need to exist to educate! Do we have real work jurassic parks? No! But children are obsessed with dinosaurs!" - them

The battle went on and in the end we agreed to disagree. At least thats how I interpret being blocked everywhere. Reflecting, I'm afraid to say, they are right. The Zoo has shown me this in recent years. They are not alone either, several zoos have undergone this process. Cory Doctorow coined a term a few years back to describe how tech companies are amazing at their mission to start with, then they slowly start to ignore that mission in search of profit. Enshittification is the term he coined; I don't think it is exclusive to tech firms.

With zoos, over time, investment into the bottom line is prioritised over education. Animal enrichment becomes a way of increasing profits. Powerful management negate local concerns by ignoring planning regulations; Councils are powerless to act after a decade of austerity. Global atrocities are exploited to sell an exciting story. Sounds dramatic, doesn't it? Unless these things are challenged, nothing changes and enshittification ensues. We can use our voice.

And what of it? Well they block you on social media to try and take away that all powerful tool, your voice. What happens when you rebel against this, and branch out by using other platforms to push your agenda? They revoke your membership. They make up reasons to justify their actions. They drag up paradoxical arguments routed in hearsay. They decide that you are a threat to their NEW mission; to afford their shareholders greater sums of money.

Along the way our zoos do some amazing things, and The Zoo is no exception, they helped to carve me into the shape I am today; a thorny shape thats digging into their back, it seems. Zoos draw millions of people into their grounds each year and show them the incredible biodiversity of Earth. The very biodiversity we are destroying. Zoos also raise money and donate it to in-situ conservation, which is great when it represents a not-insignificant proportion of their profit. Finally, they create a platform to force upon their guests the vital information and content that will help them see what it is we need to protect. Zoos are an interface between the worlds wildlife and our westernised civilisation. They have the tools to make a difference. And many are using these tools on the coal-face.

However, these same tools can be used to make money to line the pockets of the rich. If I could choose between a big fancy shopping complex complete with hotel or a new interactive and incredibly inspiring animal exhibit? I'd choose the latter. If I could only afford two signs, would I update the out of date ones, or create a new one to advertise my new amusement park attraction? I'd choose the former. If I could invest in innovative new products or downgrade existing ones and then upsell those features as a new one, I'd do the former. And, if a concerned guest, customer, or resident raised something to my attention, would I ignore them or listen? I'd listen.

I'm 28 years old. For 32% of my life I have supported The Zoo. But now, I do not. Will The Zoo be here 28 years from now? No, it will not. And at this rate, a little like the endangered animals they are professing to help. Something will be, but it won't be The Zoo.

To use their words, I am no longer a friend of The Zoo. And to that I say...

[^1]: I realised after sharing this that some of the photos here are from Berlin zoo. Decided to leave them in because I like them but didn't want to rewrite the post.

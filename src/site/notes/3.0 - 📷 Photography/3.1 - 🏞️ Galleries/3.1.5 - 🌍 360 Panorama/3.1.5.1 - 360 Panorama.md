# 360 Panorama

For as long as I've been flying drones I've been creating 360 panoramic images. I find these images engaging and incredibly good at sharing the incredible landscapes that surround us. Here are some of my favourite panoramas created over the years. 

>[!WARNING] A recommendation if I may? 
>These scenes are often vast and therefore are best explored in full screen. Click the fullscreen icon in the top left of image to do so. You can pan around by clicking and dragging (or swiping on mobile), and can zoom with a mouse wheel (or pinching on mobile).

## Neist Point

Neist Point is a very recognisable peninsula on the west coast of the Isle of Skye. The peninsula is home to an old lighthouse which is now automated in it's control.

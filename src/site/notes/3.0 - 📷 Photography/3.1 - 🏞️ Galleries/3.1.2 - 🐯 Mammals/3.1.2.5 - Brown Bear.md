# Brown Bear

The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species native to Eurasia and North America. It’s one of the largest land carnivores, rivalled only by the polar bear. Brown bears are known for their distinctive shoulder hump, which is made of muscle and helps them dig through dirt when creating their dens.

The bears in my gallery were taken in Finland where there is a healthy population of brown bears.

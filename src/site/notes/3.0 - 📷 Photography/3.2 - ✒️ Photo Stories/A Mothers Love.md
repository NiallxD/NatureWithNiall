# A Mothers Love

![](https://i.imgur.com/hpoQKL9.png)

Female grey seals are known for the remarkably strong but fragile bond they form with their pups. This bond is the sole emotional subject of this image.

Iâ€™ve seen this behavior many times before but this time it was special. Mum and pup were sharing a moment that had I not been there, would have been hidden from the world. I was sure not to disturb them at such a critical stage in the season.

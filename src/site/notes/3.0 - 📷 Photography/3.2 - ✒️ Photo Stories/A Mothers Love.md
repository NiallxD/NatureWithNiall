Female [[3.0 - 📷 Photography/3.1 - 🏞️ Galleries/3.1.2 - 🐯 Mammals/3.1.2.4 - Grey Seal\|grey seal]] are known for the remarkably strong but fragile bond they form with their pups. This bond is the sole emotional subject of this image.

I’ve seen this behavior many times before but this time it was special. Mum and pup were sharing a moment that had I not been there, would have been hidden from the world. I was sure not to disturb them at such a critical stage in the season.

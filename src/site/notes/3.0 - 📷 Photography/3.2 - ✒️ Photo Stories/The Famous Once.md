I was holidaying in the Scottish Highlands, photographing wildlife and landscapes. I headed up to Lochindorb (The Loch of Trouble), not far North-East from the small village of Carrbridge, famous for its pack-horse bridge.  

Lochindorb is a large loch surrounded by Scottish Moorland with a castle set on a rocky island in the middle, once home to the infamous Wolf of Badenoch. One of the most common birds around here is the Grouse, just like the one pictured. This was an opportunistic image that I took from my car, the heather was starting to bloom, and this stunning specimen popped up just as the sun started to shine.

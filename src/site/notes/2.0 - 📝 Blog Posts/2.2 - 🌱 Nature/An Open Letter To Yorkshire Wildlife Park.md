## An Open Letter To Yorkshire Wildlife Park

Dear Yorkshire Wildlife Park, 

I have received your letter, dated 11 April 2024, informing me that my membership has been cancelled as a result of my actions breaching your Terms & Conditions, and that I will be receiving a pro-rata refund. I am yet to receive such refund.

I wished to respond to your letter to both set the record straight and share my side of the story. I refute all but one of your accusations.

At the end of this letter, I will list the issues I've been advocating for through professional letters, emails, and on social media and the wider internet.

***Refuted: Made defamatory comments and remarks about Yorkshire Wildlife Park and its employees on social media:***

I am aware of what this accusation relates to[^1]. On a post about Love Island contestants visiting the park, I commented: 

>"Can't say I'd spot them in a crowd. You're a centre for wildlife conservation, not a reality show! Get it together!".

I was not the only commenter who said words to this effect, nor was I wrong. YWP continue to place precedence of commercial advertisements over education on their social media, when both can be achieved harmoniously (see Chester Zoo socials). This has changed in recent months to some extent with the introduction of an active Wild Life Foundation account, which is great to see, but this account has much fewer followers than your main socials. Had this been the case at the time, I would have been unlikely to comment.

I have criticised YWP several times online because I'm passionate in what I believe in, and I see what is happening at YWP, and how it undermines the potential that YWP has to change the minds of people in the UK. Richardson *et al.,* (2022) showed that the UK has some of the lowest levels of Nature-connectedness in the world; we need to address this now and YWP, along with all other zoos, are in prime position to start doing so.

Further, I've acted to point out failings in process and policy[^2], objected with genuine concerns to retrospective planning applications (as a resident)[^3], pointed out when YWP have changed things that devalue the experience for existing members[^4], and highlighted where their marketing stories aren't actually factual[^5].

>[!NOTE] In August 2022, I wrote a letter to YWP highlighting several concerns that, myself and others, had with YWP, most of which are the concerns I've been advocating for through criticism ever since. We never received a response despite being promised one. We offered to discuss our concerns with those whom were interested, no opportunity was given. I tried to address concerns professionally and privately and I didn't even get an acknowledgement let alone any changes made. I had no choice to bring this into the public forum.

YWP's comment about employees is false and unfounded. I have never been nasty or criticised anyone individually at YWP. I'm always amicable with staff, even those who show a disliking to me and others (I can name at least three employees who have been unprofessional with me[^6]). In my criticism I've referred to 'Keepers' however this has usually being directed at management. I know many of the keeping staff at YWP, and I think they are fantastic. Furthermore, I, along with others, have being subject bullying by YWP employees online. A paying member was openly called "a nob sack" publicly, online by one of YWP staff members. Additionally, I have been subjected to undue criticism on how I have achieved my photographs (see disturbing animals).

May I add that criticism is not defamation. Might I also add that I am not the only person who expresses negative opinions about YWP online.

***Refuted: Disrupted and disturbed our animals when you have been at YWP for the purposes of taking photographs:***

This is not entirely correct. One staff member who no longer works at YWP said that I was running up and down the tiger walk way to make the tigers run and this is how I got my photos of the tiger running. Might I point out I cannot run and photograph at the same time, go figure. I will agree that on occasion I have jogged from one end of the tiger walkway to the other and Tschuna has followed; but can I add she does the same when I walk past, am I to crawl? In any case, this has been a handful of times and never when it's busy at the park and is usually me trying to get in front of the her to take photos of her walking towards me. At the time, this keeper told me it was me who makes Tschuna frustrated. Since then, when asked why the tigers don't get swapped around anymore, the keeper told me that it's because Tschuna finds the large numbers of people walking by the pond enclosure stressful; is it me or is it everyone else? And if it is me, why did it take getting my membership revoked to be told about it in a professional manner (social media posts by an exiting employee is not the professional way to address something).

Further, children regularly run up and down by the tigers so I am not alone in this behaviour. There are no signs to suggest this could be disturbing the animals and nobody has raised this with me despite me speaking to almost all staff I see. I note the Okapi have a 'Do not bang on the glass' sign up. How about a 'No running by the ~~poolside~~ Tigers'. Finally, nobody has done anything about it. If the animals welfare is your top priority, why has it taken this long for anything to be said?

For the above reasons, your accusation is just not true. I would expect a keeper to pull up any visitor that is disturbing the animals and this has not happened suggesting this is merely based on historic comments by certain staff members, those who feel it's appropriate to say nasty things online to paying customers. I feel as though this has been included in your reasoning in order to 'flesh it out'.

My photos of a running tiger are from me waiting patiently. I don't call their names (others do), I'm patient. I have been stood with staff many times and Tschuna has sprinted towards me. I don't know why she does this, but she does. Perhaps its because I've known Tschuna for longer than most of YWP staff.

>[!TIP] If YWP are concerned that I disrupt and disturb the animals, then it may wish to reconsider hosting concerts, setting up bigtop tents, filling the park with artificial light after dark and allowing other guests to whistle, shout, scream, chase and throw things at the animals.

>[!WARNING] UPDATE Oct 2024
>As of October 2024, I've been told that Tschuna now spends the vast majority of her spare time in the pond side, the side which YWP keepers told me was 'too stressful for her'. My take is this; YWP don't employ enough keepers to stick to rotation schedules as it is a resource pressure. Since Sayan sadly passed away, there is no need to move tigers around to swap them, they just leave the gates open and Tschuna chooses the pond side. More lies by YWP as a result of poor financial management/decisions.


***Refuted: Published misleading and incorrect information about our opening times on social media implying that it is factual news from YWP:***

Refuted on the grounds of a mistake that was promptly rectified and I never implied it was factual from YWP. I will hold my hands up here, I did share incorrect information about the park opening times. I was out photographing wildlife when someone messaged me stating members had to pay to get in over Easter. I negligently shared the email on my group and shared incorrect info. A staff member kindly corrected me after which I then removed the post. I had acted out of frustration which clouded my judgement. On reflection, the email wasn't 100% clear as echoed by others, but I responded appropriately by removing the post. 

I had previously asked if YWP would like to help moderate the group I run on Facebook to help share clear information about the YWP. This offer hadn't been taken up, as usual there is no consideration given to the fan groups. Several members are frustrated with the lack of communication from YWP and I had aimed to try and improve this situation. YWP has experienced several 'gates' recently[^13], and not the locked ones at the STEPS concert. It's positive to see that the park now share important updates in a header on their Website; lo and behold, people critiquing on social media can make YWP improve.


***Partially Upheld: Amending Yorkshire Wildlife Park's Wikipedia page to say that we are an  'amusement park' when you are fully aware that we are not an amusement park:*** 

Wikipedia is an open online resource that anyone can edit, it's not a source of truth. I edit wikipedia pages now and then when I see things that are factually incorrect.

It came to my attention that YWP had updated their SIC codes (business activity) from:
- 91040: Botanical and zoological gardens and nature reserves activities
to...
- 93210: Activities of amusement parks and theme parks

This is not false information as the YWP does operate to amuse guests with activities and attractions. I do not object to this in anyway (aside from the big wheel), it is a good thing when it can draw in funds to support conservation. This was bolstered by YWP's comments that the Big Wheel is critical to the parks success[^14], something an amusement park might say.

I'd also like to be clear on what an amusement park is: "a large outdoor area with fairground rides, shows and other entertainments".

- A large outdoor area: Yes - at over 100 acres.
- Fairground rides: Such as the big wheel which the park are wanting to become permanent.
- Shows: Such as the concerts held in summer.
- Other Entertainments: Such as seasonal events (Illuminations, Easter, Halloween etc).

You know the proverb, 'If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck'.

If YWP want to go down this route, they should own it instead of misleading visitors calling it a solely a Wildlife Park. Their current approach, which is being adopted by many many other zoos, undermines their mission. [It is a sign that the zoo model proposed back in the 70s needs a rethink](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.109925)

Final note: I didn't remove any information that was already there, I just added to it. I considered amending anonymously but chose to put my name to it to maintain integrity.


***Refuted: Published photographs taken at YWP on your commercial website which you are not permitted to do under our terms and conditions. We request that you remove these immediately.***

Correct, I and any other visitors, are not permitted to use film and photos for commercial purpose. *"**Filming and/or photography for Public Broadcast, commercial purposes, training or student projects are strictly prohibited without the express prior written agreement of WLG/YWP"**.* 

However, I will not be removing any photographs shared online. The photos are not shared for commercial purposes. I do not derive any commercial or financial gain from images taken at YWP and instead only use them to promote conservation. I'd like to remind YWP that I own the copyright to the photographs that I make. I apologise if YWP believe my webiste is commercial in nature, it's my personal project so I'll take this as a compliment. While I do advertise some services on an ad-hoc basis, I rarely act on this and, when I do, it has nothing to do with YWP.

I thank YWP for what it has given me, particularly in it's early years. Over the past 10 years, YWP has given me a space to develop my passion for nature, which led me to be the person I am today; someone who advocates for wildlife and is not afraid to call out people and organisations when they behave irresponsibly. Had YWP stayed on track, it would not have come to this. Now, I'm saddened to see how the park has changed, a sentiment echoed by many. But as Elizabeth Gilbert wrote "Resist change at your own peril. When something ends, let it end", it's time to draw a line in the sand.

### Appendix

Here are the issues for which I've been advocating for change. Some are bespoke to YWP others are across the Zoo industry:

1. Utilise social media presence and reach to inform and educate the wider public about the Zoos mission and it's progress; Educate the public about the biodiversity crisis; Raise funds for in-situ conservation[^7].
2. Update and maintain in-park signage to reflect changes in the status of species in the wild and within the park's own collection[^8].
3. Develop voluntary, or contracted, education officers within the park to engage and educate guests[^9].
4. Deliver added value services to increase funds without devaluing existing services[^4].
5. Engage in high-quality enrichment and feeding regimes[^10].
6. Outwardly prioritise the Zoo's mission over commercial events and assets[^11].
7. Be open and honest with locals, respect local planning regulations, and hold forum for discussion with concerned parties[^12].

### Footnotes

[^1]: I have a message from a YWP employee advising me that this was the reason they blocked me on social media.
[^2]: YWP stopped letting members in after 16:00 when the new entrance opened despite us not having this restriction before. No matter what I tried to get it sorted, nobody helped or responded.
[^3]: The big wheel. Retrospective planning (objected out of principle), looks ugly and can be seen for miles around (including on my regular walk in the next village along) and is not where YWP should be investing it's money.
[^4]: Removed the ability to just turn up on a standard pass and sold this as a benefit to the new gold pass.
[^5]: While it's amazing what YWP have done, they did not rescue the lions from bombs in Ukraine. They rescued them from a small but safe place in Poland. Keepers in Ukraine and Poland risked their lives to that YWP can pedal a false story that they are the heroes. Doesn't sit right with me at all. This was brought to my attention on a popular zoo forum where this was being discussed. Another story shared in the media that was factually incorrect, yet completely unaddressed by YWP, was about the 'new planning permission in April 2024 for a new animal' which many online falsely interpreted as Gorillas when in fact it was a retrospective application for the Cheetahs.
[^6]: When leaving the park at closing time an employee said 'you should know better, we don't get paid overtime you know" despite it not even being closing time yet. Another occasion was when I was told to move from an enclosure after about 2 minutes because 'other guests might want to see'. Another occasion was when an employee was asked 'do you know why the tiger is locked away?' to which the response was 'because we are filling the pond with water with a pump.' No issue there, until asked for a rough time when they said 'as long as it takes' before walking off. Other examples of employees down right ignoring me when I say hello, being told lies to genuine questions and generally making me feel unwelcome. Not all staff are like this, but a handful are.
[^7]: A brief survey of social media accounts of the top zoos in the UK placed YWP in the bottom quartile for ratio of commercial (non-conservation related) to educational posts where a low score represents high ration of commercial to educational posts.
[^8]: As of my last visit, the Tiger signage is still from 2015, as is much of the leopard signage. The tiger signage still states the 'Tschuna and Vladimir are hoping to have cubs' (paraphrased).
[^9]: Keepers do provide talks but these are at set times, often when guests have left for the day. Voluntary education assistants are a massive boon to Zoos such as Chester and Whipsnade and would help free up time for keepers to do other things of which I'm told time is stretched.
[^10]: I don't think the 'throw over the fence' is the most enriching technique. YWP used to do regular scatter feeds and these days they are few and far between which I presume is due to keeper resources. Enrichment is carried out to a good level, but often it feel half-hearted when compared to what I've seen at other Zoos in the UK.
[^11]: This relates to the social media section, but more closely focusses on the constant sharing of commercialised content over broader zoo industry content such as their role, how they help nature, and what their plans are for the future.
[^12]: YWP continue to ignore local planning laws by developing with permission and then seeking retrospective permission. This places a lot of pressure on the local authority and prevent residents from having their say ahead of the development. Some of this with is less than 500 m from peoples homes.
[^13]: Im referring to occasions where half the animals were locked away due to a power failure and nobody telling paying guests at the entrance or when they have advertised a new animal but failed to share the fact that it is off-show. Recent updates on the website banner have helped address these issues which is nice to see!
[^14]: When justifying the importance of the Big Wheel, YWP stated it is crucial to the parks success.  This is contained in planning documents on the Doncaster Council Planning Portal.

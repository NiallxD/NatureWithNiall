>[!TIP] Hello!
>You’re probably here because you searched for Northern Lights Doncaster. I’ll update this in the morning but I wanted to share something.

In the early hours, 11th May 2024, the UK was treated to a Northern Lights bonanza! I’ve seen the Northern Lights in Iceland and this nearly beat that! 

What was odd was how the lights seemed to originate from directly above me.

>[!TIP] Hello!
>You’re probably here because you searched for Northern Lights Doncaster. I’ll update this in the morning but I wanted to share something.

In the early hours, 11th May 2024, the UK was treated to a Northern Lights bonanza! I’ve seen the Northern Lights in Iceland and this nearly beat that! 

What was odd was how the lights seemed to originate from directly above me.

## What Causes the Aurora?

The Aurora, both in the north and south - and on other planets, is caused by high energy particles ejected from the sun. These particles, colloquially knows as Solar Wind, fly across space and eventually strike the Earths Magnetosphere. This is the magnetic field which protects us from exactly this kind of event. The magnetic fields curve out from each pole so when the particles come into the influence of the Earths Magnetic field, they are deflected towards the poles, for the more part.

## Where Do The Colours Come From?

These magnetic fields protect us on earth from the powerful solar winds which could destroy our electrical systems, and more. When the particles are guided towards the poles, they then start to sink deeper into the atmosphere where they encounter gasses such as oxygen and nitrogen. Skimming over the physics todo with electrons and energy levels, when the particles strike a gas molecule, some light is released. 

Oxygen molecules emit a green light and with nitrogen emitting a blue/purple glow. The colours are coming from the gas molecules emitting photons after being stuck by high energy particles from the sun.

## Summary

So in summary we have these high energy particles blasted towards us from the sun, the Earth does what it can to protect us but ultimately some make it down to the atmosphere where they cause gasses to emit photons that we can see. 

How cool is that?

A final note, I think this is a great example of how the Earth is a living and breathing system, working to protect us. And yet we destroy it a little more each day. We have something special to protect so let’s all do our bit!

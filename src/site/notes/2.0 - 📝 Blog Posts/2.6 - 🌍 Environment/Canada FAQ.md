# Travelling to Canada: FAQ

After a few months in the Alliance Visa group chat, I noticed a lot of questions cropping up again and again. Some people were not getting answers, presumably because folk were getting sick of typing the same things over and over. So I’ve set up this FAQ where I’ll put all the responses to the questions that keep cropping up along with some info that I have found myself/learned from friends in Canada. I hope it’s useful!

***Admin and disclaimer stuff at the bottom of the page[^1][^2]***

## Insurance

>[!INFO]- What is the cheapest health insurance?
>
>>IEC Visa Requirement
>The minimum required cover under the International Experience Canada Visa is Medical Care, Hospitalisation, and Repatriation. Your visa will only be granted for the period covered by your insurance!
>
>### Insurance companies people have used:
>1. [Big Cat Travel Insurance](https://www.bigcattravelinsurance.com) (2 people)
>2. [Backpacker](https://www.backpackertravelinsurance.ie/travel-insurance-canada.asp) (2 people)
>3. [True Traveller](https://www.truetraveller.com/) (1 person)
>### What people said:
>- "I got mine here [Big Cat Travel Insurance](https://www.bigcattravelinsurance.com)"
>- "We went with backpacker, they're fairly good"
>- "Medical insurance also. It's a requirement for the IEC. Have friends in Canada and backpacker worked fine for them. Costs around €600 depending on how much you add in"
>- "Me and my boyfriend just sorted ours, went with big cat. £876 (with winter sport). And we went with their cheaper option"
>- "I went with “True Traveller” insurance and went for the most basic package. It covers all of the requirements that they look for in insurance. Think it was about £600 for 2 years."

## Money

>[!INFO]- How much money is a good amount to take?
>
>>IEC Visa Requirement
>>The requirement under the International Experience Canada Visa is CAN$2,500.
>
>### How much people said they have/are taking:
>1. £5,000-£10,000
>2. CAN$2,500
>3. CAN$10,000
>4. £5,000
>
>### What people said:
>- "I think £5000 - £10,000 would be plenty"
>- "If you don't have a job lined up, i think you might struggle to live comfortable on 2500 CAD also you gotta take rent into account if your staying hotel or Air B&B without credit score you maybe asked to pay more than your deposit and first months rent"
>- "Yeah id say £5k ‘minimum"
>- "As for funds this truly depends on your lifestyle choices, but a generic amount that I think would be sufficient for most is $10,000"

>[!INFO]- Can anyone recommend a good bank?
> 
>Canadian Banks
>Many banks in Canada charge for their services as standard. Check all fees before signing up!
> 
> ### Banks recommended:
> 
> 1. Scotia Bank (fees if less than CAN$5,000)
> 2. CIBC
> 3. TD Canada
> 
> ### What people said:
> - "I think I'm gonna go for Scotia Bank since HSBC currently aren't allowing new accounts because they're merging with another company or something, so might be a few months until you can go for them. Scotia seem alright as long as you have over 5k in it at all times otherwise they'll charge you each month"
> - "CIBC will waive their fees for two years if you are a newcomer."
> - "TD is a good bank"

> [!INFO]- What evidence is sufficient to prove I have CAN$2,500?
> 
>>Official Immigration Canada Statement
>>The border services officer may also ask for proof of funds.You must present a statement of your bank account issued no more than **1 week before** your departure for Canada. It must clearly show that you have enough money to support yourself for the first 3 months of your stay in Canada (the equivalent of CAN$2,500).
> 
> ### Evidence people used:
> 
> 1. English bank statement
> 2. Statement from Revolut
>
> ### What people said:
>- "Proof of funds, bank statement that shows you have over $2500, the bank statement has to be less than a week old"
>- "It can even be a statement from revolute thats what i gave and they accepted it"
>- "Apparently it doesn't need to be \[from a] Canadian \[bank]. Asked Alliance the other day about it"
> 
> Note: If you are taking over CAN$10,000 you might need to look into how best to proceed. There are restrictions on moving large sums of cash into the country. The official statement from Immigration Canada is below:
> 
> If you arrive in Canada with the equivalent of CAN$10,000 or more, you must tell the border services officer. If you do not, you could be fined or put in prison. These funds could be in the form of:
> - cash
> - securities in bearer form (for example, stocks, bonds, debentures, treasury bills) **or**
> - bankers’ drafts, cheques, travellers’ cheques or money orders

## Getting Around

> [!INFO]- Do you need a Canadian driving license and how do you get one?
> 
>>Canadian Driving License
>>There isn’t such thing as a Canadian driving license. Each province set their own rules about this and therefore it will differ depending on where you intend to drive.
> 
> ### Summary by province:
> 
> 1. **Alberta:** You can swap your UK licence for an Alberta driving licence.
> 2. **Calgary:** International Driving Permit offers 1 year driving on UK license.
> 3. **BC:** International Driving Permit offers 90 days on UK license. You can swap a full UK driving licence for a BC license at any ICBC office at anytime.
> 
> ### What people said:
> 
> 1. You can use your uk driving license in Alberta as a straight swap for a Canadian license. It takes a week or two to come in the post but it's super simple. I swapped my license in November and bought a car here
> 2. I’m from Ireland moving to Calgary I don’t know if it would be much different from the UK but from the research I’ve done I need to get an international driving permit in Ireland before I leave and it’s valid for 1 year, so gives me 1 year to get sorted properly over there as far as I know

## Arriving In Canada

>[!INFO]- How long does immigration at the airport take?
> 
>Check you have everything you need before you arrive in Canada. Immigration Canada has a handy guide [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/iec/prepare-arrival.html).
>

> 2. **Calgary:** No mention of major delays, just flew to the airport and activated visa.
> 3. **Vancouver:**

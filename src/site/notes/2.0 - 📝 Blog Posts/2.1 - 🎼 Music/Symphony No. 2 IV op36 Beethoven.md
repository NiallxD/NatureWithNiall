Beethoven’s second symphony is a beautiful composition with lots going on. This post specifically looks at the fourth movement.

What’s so interesting about the fourth movement? Well, just last week I spent at least three hours waiting patiently, trying to spot a certain bird in a bush. I was not to see this bird as after hours and hours I gave up. The bird in question is the Cetti’s Warbler (pronounced ”Chettys”) which is well known for being a nightmare to try and spot. You hear this bird miles off, it’s got such a powerfully and instantly identifiable song you can’t help but look for it.

The Cetti’s warbler song is characterised by a short motif of about 6 notes projected clearly and powerfully. It’s unmistakable. Now, it might be a coincidence, but Beethoven’s 4th movement of his second symphony starts with an opening motif which sounds suspiciously like the song of the Cetti’s.

## Beethoven’s Rambling Walks

Beethoven spent a lot of time out of the city at his brothers residence which was surrounded by nature. He frequently went on mad rambling walks through the country where he probably came up with a lot of his genius ideas. Could Beethoven have heard a Cetti’s and took inspiration from it? There is a good chance he did. It might not have been conscious as pointed out by David Turner in his book, “Was Beethoven a Birdwatcher”, but it’s almost certainly what inspired the opening bars. 

Go listen to the movement and the bird song and see if you pick up on it. It’s remarkably similar! As much as I love Beethoven, I think the Cetti’s warbler does it better!
